This package aims to fix the bugs of "wttree.scm" of "MIT/GNU Scheme"
and "slib".

"wttree.scm" is a finite map (key-value store) which also provides
set operations. It is based on "weight balanced trees", a variant
of binary search trees.

The original weight balanced tree is invested by Nievergelt and
Reingold in 1972. Its weight is "size + 1". The balance algorithm has
two parameters, delta and gamma. 
They defined (delta,gamma) = (1 + sprt 2, sqrt 2). 
This algorithm and this parameter does not have bugs. That is, the
balance of a tree is always maintained.

In 1992, Adams created a variant of weight balanced tree. Its weight
is purely "size". He defined (delta,gamma) = (3 or larger, 1).  The
pair (delta,gamma) of "wttree.scm" is (5,1). They are all buggy.  In
some cases, the delete operation on a given balanced tree breaks its
balance. To our tests, only (3,2) and (4,2) are valid. But we cannot
prove it mathematically.

We (Mr. Hirai and me) mathematically proved the original weight
balanced tree (not Adams's one) is valid only with (3,2) in Coq.

To fix "wttree.scm", we should translate the definition of weight from
"size" to "size + 1" and change the parameters from (5,1) to (3,2).

For slib:

Gauche is required as Scheme implementation.

	% cd slib
	;; To run tests for the new "wttree.scm"
	% make
	;; All property tests are passed.

	;; To run test for the old "wttree.scm"
	% make old
	;; Some property tests are failed.
